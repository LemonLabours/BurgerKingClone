# BurgerKingClone
Burger King App Clone using SwiftUI and Firebase. 
Still a work in progress. 

# Description 
This repository hosts the source code for a SwiftUI-based iOS application that serves as a clone of the Burger King app.

The goal of this project is to emulate the primary features and UI/UX design of the Burger King app, utilizing SwiftUI and Combine frameworks to build an interactive, responsive, and appealing interface.

Features of this app include browsing through the menu, selecting items, adding them to a shopping cart, customizing orders, viewing promotional offers, and managing user profiles. While this project doesn't interface with Burger King's actual backend, it uses mock data to simulate real-world app behavior and interactions.

Please be aware that this project is intended solely for educational purposes, showcasing the power and flexibility of SwiftUI in recreating complex, real-world applications. It is not in any way affiliated with, officially supported by, or endorsed by Burger King or its parent company, Restaurant Brands International.

We welcome contributions and feedback to improve this educational resource!
